#  Amazon Prime Content Analysis

This project explores the Amazon Prime Video dataset to uncover valuable insights about its content library. The goal is to understand trends in genres, regional content distribution, top-rated shows, the evolution of the content library over time, and more.

##  Problem Statement

The aim of this analysis is to answer some simple but meaningful questions:

- What genres and categories dominate Amazon Prime?
- How is content distributed across different countries?
- How has Amazon Prime's content library grown or changed over the years?
- What are the highest-rated or most popular shows?
- What is the share of movies vs. TV shows?
- Are there any relationships between ratings, votes, runtime, and popularity?

This analysis can help content strategists and decision-makers at Amazon Prime (or similar platforms) understand user preferences, regional trends, and performance of content types to improve future offerings.
